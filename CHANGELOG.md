# CHANGELOG

### 0.4.2
- Fix issues with README file.
- Remove 'preview' from extension manifest.

### 0.4.1
- Code clean up. No functional changes.

### 0.4.0
- 'Leap' command now works differently when used via the `Tab` keybinding vs. the command palette command. 'Leap' requires line of sight (i.e. have no non-whitespace text between the cursor position and the leap target) when used via the `Tab` key, while the command palette key does not.

### 0.3.0
- Change default keybinding of 'Escape Leaper Mode' to `Shift` + `Escape` so that there is less conflict with other built-in editor keybindings for `Escape`.

### 0.2.1
- Command to 'leap' and 'escape leaper mode' added into the command pallete when the context allows for it.

### 0.2.0
- Refactored a majority of the code. 
- Extension now works properly during text insertion and deletion.

### 0.1.0 
- Initial release of the extension. 
- Pre 0.1.0 versions are part of an old implementation that can be found here: https://github.com/OnlyLys/Leaper-Old-Implementation
